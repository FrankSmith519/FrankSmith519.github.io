# ePortfolio

## Introduction
I am Senior Automation Technician / Lead HVAC Controls Programmer that is studying to obtain a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I have worked through the SNHU course program which is concluding with CS - 499 and the completion of this ePortfolio.

## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering
This artifact is a completed 3D graphic design scene that was the final project of my CS -330 course Computer Graphic and Visualization. I took a photo of a scene in my room containing a wooden chest, some books of one of my favorite book series, and a sage stick and I was tasked with recreating that scene within a computer. These were completed in the term prior to this term so at the end of 2024.

I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio as it is as polished a final product that I have submitted within my course program. It illustrates my understanding of the course content and my ability to navigate and manipulate the C+ code that was provided. I improved the artifact as part of this milestone by removing some lights in the scene and then intensifying some of the lights already present to allow the scene to be brighter. This allows the scene to pop more which I believe is an improvement.

I believe I was able to meet the course outcomes that I outlined in Module One and I did not need to make any updates to the coverage plans. I knew that it was going to be a challenge to get the lighting to work the way I wanted but I was able to make the necessary changes to improve the scene.

As I was improving the scene, I began to understand the value adjustments to the specular and diffuse settings for the lights better. I struggled with making minute changes originally that didnâ€™t result with the brightening that I was wanting to see. I started to iterate through the lights to confirm their functionality within the scene and I cut out a light that did not improve the lighting of the scene much. I then began to make larger changes to the specular and diffuse settings of each light which I was then able to gain an understanding of how those settings controlled the brightness and location of the lights. This allowed me to complete the artifact improvement as intended.

## Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure
This artifact is a clock time program that takes variables set manually for the time for both the 12-hour clock as well as the 24-hour clock. It would then print those times out both the 12-hour and 24-hour and then allow the user to input choices to increase the hour, minute, or second values to adjust the time as needed. This was one of the first coding assignment I completed as part of the computer science program.

I included this artifact within my ePortfolio as it would be a great representation of what code I provided early on in the program and what adjustments I can complete to improve the code this far into the program. I wanted to illustrate how I can adjust the code to take the local time of the user and automatically show that time rather than use preset variables that are entered statically. Then the user can adjust the time from the automated time, or they can enter a time manually to adjust at their convenience.

I believe I was able to complete the outcomes that I have planned out and more. The data input has improved as the time is obtained automatically and I was able to illustrate the accurate times as the inputs are received by the user.

I was able to learn how to properly obtain the local time safely as I did run into issues using localtime variables that Visual Studio did not approve of. I was able to research different methods that could be used and then properly deployed those methods to obtain the data I was intending to use.

## Enhancement Three: Databases
This artifact is the same code that was used as part of the final project of my computer graphics and visualization class. The focus for this enhancement was regarding the material database that is used to set out the light interacts with the different objects in the scene. This artifact was completed at the end of last term which was at the end of 2024.

I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio as I believe it will be an ideal representation of my ability to recognize a database that is limited and to enhance that database which will ultimately lead to an improvement of the entire artifact. By adding materials to the list of materials to choose from I can make further adjustments to individual objects rather than general adjustments which has improved the look of the completed scene.

I was able to meet the course outcomes regarding this enhancement as the material database was improved and the overall look of the scene improved which was the goal.

This update was not very challenging as already understood how to deploy the material database updates. The only challenge was making minute adjustments to the diffuse and specular color settings as well as assigning the necessary shininess of the material to ensure the light reacted with the material properly. I spent some time with that process, but it was very straightforward.
