# ePortfolio

## Introduction
I am Senior Automation Technician / Lead HVAC Controls Programmer that is studying to obtain a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I have worked through the SNHU course program which is concluding with CS - 499 and the completion of this ePortfolio.

## Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering
This artifact is a completed 3D graphic design scene that was the final project of my CS -330 course Computer Graphic and Visualization. I took a photo of a scene in my room containing a wooden chest, some books of one of my favorite book series, and a sage stick and I was tasked with recreating that scene within a computer. These were completed in the term prior to this term so at the end of 2024.

I wanted to include this artifact in my ePortfolio as it is as polished a final product that I have submitted within my course program. It illustrates my understanding of the course content and my ability to navigate and manipulate the C+ code that was provided. I improved the artifact as part of this milestone by removing some lights in the scene and then intensifying some of the lights already present to allow the scene to be brighter. This allows the scene to pop more which I believe is an improvement.

I believe I was able to meet the course outcomes that I outlined in Module One and I did not need to make any updates to the coverage plans. I knew that it was going to be a challenge to get the lighting to work the way I wanted but I was able to make the necessary changes to improve the scene.

As I was improving the scene, I began to understand the value adjustments to the specular and diffuse settings for the lights better. I struggled with making minute changes originally that didnâ€™t result with the brightening that I was wanting to see. I started to iterate through the lights to confirm their functionality within the scene and I cut out a light that did not improve the lighting of the scene much. I then began to make larger changes to the specular and diffuse settings of each light which I was then able to gain an understanding of how those settings controlled the brightness and location of the lights. This allowed me to complete the artifact improvement as intended.
